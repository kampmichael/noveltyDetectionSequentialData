# Novelty Detection in Sequential Data by Informed Clustering and Modeling

This repository corresponds to the experiments performed in "Informed Novelty Detection in Sequential Data by Per-Cluster Modeling" (https://openreview.net/forum?id=oMZVzssNkd).
Please note that the visual analytics tool used in the work was introduced in "LDA Ensembles for Interactive Exploration and Categorization of Behaviors" by Chen S., et al.
